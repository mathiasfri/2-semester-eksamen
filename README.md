# Welcome to Project Calculator Tool

### Introduction
Welcome to Project Calculator Tool. In this website you can create a project and plan out what it is going to include and how much time the project would need. You can create your own projects and you can share the workspace of a project by assigning the people you want to be working with to the project.

#### Assign a user to a project, subproject or task

--- 
1. When you are logged in, click on the project you have created that you want to assign a user to.
2. Once you have clicked on the project, a bar with the text **Assign project to user** will appear. In the bar, you can input the **e-mailadress** on the user you wish to assign to the project and click enter on the keyboard.
3. You have now assigned the user to the project.
4. You can do the same thing with Subproject and Tasks. By assigning a user to a project you grant them access to the **entire** project. When you assign a user to a subProject or a task, the text of the parts the user is assigned to will be marked with yellow. This way, you know what assigments you need to complete.
